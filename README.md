# CRA for Seven patterns by example

This project has built a CRA writing seven different ways of implementing a RadioGroup component explained at [this article](https://techblog.commercetools.com/seven-patterns-by-example-the-many-ways-to-type-radio-in-react-bfe14322bb6f).

- Pattern 1: Defining RadioGroup and an options argument
- Pattern 2: Defining RadioGroup and RadioOption components
- Pattern 3: Compound components through RadioGroup
- Pattern 4: A shared `context` for RadioGroup and RadioOption
- Pattern 5: RadioGroup with Function as a Child (FaaC)
- Pattern 6: RadioGroup with prop getters for RadioOption
- Pattern 7: RadioGroup dynamically creates RadioOption
